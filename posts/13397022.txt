Fill countries in python basemap
Hi I am trying to plot a map using pythons basemap with some countries filled in a certain colour .
Is there a quick and easy solution out there ??
Maybe useful : geophysique.be / 2011 / 01 / 27
I beleive this helps : matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com
Thanks for those comments , they where most helpful . I also found a site with free country data , which was just what I was looking for : http://www.naturalearthdata.com
@USER - you could answer your own question with a small code snippet and output ?
As has already been said by @USER , Thomas ' post here is exactly what you are after .
Should you want to do this with Cartopy , the corresponding code ( in v0.7 ) can be adapted from http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/tutorials/using_the_shapereader.html slightly :
Please note that you should post the essential parts of the answer here , on this site , or your post risks being deleted See the FAQ where it mentions answers that are ' barely more than a link ' . You may still include the link if you wish , but only as a ' reference ' . The answer should stand on its own without needing the link .
Thanks @USER - I can see why that would be the case . I've updated the answer to give some new information ( without duplicating the original link , which I did not own the copyright on ) . Cheers ,
Calling shpreader.natural_earth gives me an http 404 not found error , it apparently tries to download it ?
That's right . There are gigabytes of data available to you on Natural Earth - it wouldn't be practical to install them all . If you update your cartopy version to v0.11.2 the recent change in NaturalEarth's URL scheme will be reflected , and you will no longer get a 404 . github.com/SciTools/cartopy/pull/472 relates .
Inspired by the answer from pelson , I post the solution I have . I will leave it up to you which works best , so I will not accept any answer at the moment .
This is the result
Here is my example how to fill in Albania in the correct colour ( not very elegant I know ;)) .
It is important that you do this after you have done all the other shapes . Perhaps you can get rid of some part of this code , but as I said it was sufficient for me .
For my application I coloured contries by name or continent , therefore these lines :
The data used I got from this website : http://www.naturalearthdata.com
Your Albania is sinked . Not that many will notice :D
Yes , actually the same happens to Armenia . I had to to a work arround , by explicitly filling these two countries in afterwards . The inquiery with the people from naturalearthdata was not conclusive and I did not follow this up once I fixed it for me
@USER I have the same problem with Argentina and Angola . Can you post your solution to the " Albanian problem " ? What did the folks at NaturalEarth say ? Thanks .
@USER Does Albania appear if you change the alpha ? For example ` lines.set_alpha ( 0.5 )` ?
@USER .carstensen see my updated answer for your first question . I opened a topic in the NaturalEarth data forum ( naturalearthdata.com/forums/topic/armenia-under-water ) but it was not conclusive . And I did not follow it up after I got this hack implemented . And for your last question . I have not tried this , but do let me know if that has a positive effect .
