Defining a discrete colormap for imshow in matplotlib
I have a simple image that I'm showing with imshow in matplotlib . I'd like to apply a custom colormap so that values between 0-5 are white , 5-10 are red ( very simple colors ) , etc . I've tried following this tutorial :
http://assorted-experience.blogspot.com/2007/07/custom-colormaps.html with the following code :
But this ends up showing strange colors , and I only need 3-4 colors that I want to define . How do I do this ?

You can use a ` ListedColormap ` to specify the white and red as the only colors in the color map , and the bounds determine where the transition is from one color to the next :
The resulting figure has only two colors :
I proposed essentially the same thing for a somewhat different question : 2D grid data visualization in Python
The solution is inspired by a matplotlib example . The example explains that the ` bounds ` must be one more than the number of colors used .
The ` BoundaryNorm ` is a normalization that maps a series of values to integers , which are then used to assign the corresponding colors . ` cmap.N ` , in the example above , just defines the number of colors .
for why ` LinearSegmentedColormap ` shows strange color , I think this link would be helpful .
