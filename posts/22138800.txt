Reading data from CSV using pandas
I am trying to read data from a csv using pandas , like so :
I wish for this to give me a list of the 2nd column of the FinalCSVFin.csv . However , it is returning the error :
An extract of the CSV :
What have I done incorrectly here ?

@USER Code updated . Error message is the same ! Thank you :)
What version of pandas ? This works in 0.13.1 ( with these few lines ) , can you reproduce with a file and just these lines ?
1 ) A better way
2 ) Your code
You define a function to Read a file using ` genfromtxt ` method in numpy , and then use pandas to read you file . I suggest the latter , just use ` read_csv ` method in pandas ( as was described in 1 ) .
3 ) Suggestions
Here are the points you can change to get your code working .
You implement a function to read data using ` np.genfromtxt ` . The problems are inconsistency in delimiter and also the lack of ` dtype ` in ` genfromtxt ` . I edit your function as follows :
This gives you a list of tuples . If your file ( i.e. FinalCSVFin.csv ) uses " ; " as delimiter , call this function as follows :
