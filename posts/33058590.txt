Pandas Dataframe : Replacing NaN with row average
I am trying to learn pandas but i have been puzzled with the following please . I want to replace NaNs is a dataframe with the row average . Hence something like ` df.fillna ( df.mean ( axis=1 ))` should work but for some reason it fails for me . Am I missing anything please , something I'm doing wrong ? Is is because its not implemented ; see link here
However something like this looks to work fine
That functionality is still not implemented - the issue remains open .
Ok , thanks for this !
As commented the axis argument to fillna is NotImplemented .
Note : this would be critical here as you don't want to fill in your nth columns with the nth row average .
For now you'll need to iterate through :
An alternative is to fillna the transpose and then transpose , which may be more efficient ...
Thanks Andy , nice reply
