Hiding axis text in matplotlib plots
I'm trying to plot a figure without tickmarks or numbers on either of the axes ( I use axes in the traditional sense , not the matplotlib nomenclature ! ) . An issue I have come across is where matplotlib adjusts the x ( y ) ticklabels by subtracting a value N , then adds N at the end of the axis .
This may be vague , but the following simplified example highlights the issue , with ' 6.18 ' being the offending value of N :
The three things I would like to know are :
How to turn off this behaviour in the first place ( although in most cases it is useful , it is not always ! ) I have looked through ` matplotlib.axis.XAxis ` and cannot find anything appropriate
How can I make N disappear ( i.e. ` X.set_visible ( False )`)
Is there a better way to do the above anyway ? My final plot would be 4x4 subplots in a figure , if that is relevant .
Instead of hiding each element , you can hide the whole axis :
Or , you can set the ticks to an empty list :
In this second option , you can still use ` plt.xlabel() ` and ` plt.ylabel() ` to add labels to the axes .
Hey Ofri - that's great , thanks , but now ( just to be awkward ) what happens if I want to add an xlabel() ? Other than manually placing a text widget .
edited to answer your question .
great - works as advertised , thanks !
How can you extend this example to 3d ? ax = plt.gca ( projection= ' 3d ') , ax.axes.get_zaxis() .set_visible ( False ) gives `' Axes3DSubplot ' object has no attribute ' get_zaxis '`
This answer does not allow grid lines to show . The answer by @USER castro does though ...
If you want to hide just the axis text keeping the grid lines :
Doing ` set_visible ( False )` or ` set_ticks ([ ])` will also hide the grid lines .
A bit late - but better than the accepted answer .
Somewhat of an old thread but , this seems to be a faster method using the latest version of matplotlib :
set the major formatter for the x-axis
What if you only want to do it for a single tick ?
Yes , this is useful to only hide the labels , because .set_xticks ([ ]) also removes the tick marks themselves .
If you are like me and don't always retrieve the axes , ` ax ` , when plotting the figure , then a simple solution would be to do
I was not actually able to render an image without borders or axis data based on any of the code snippets here ( even the one accepted at the answer ) . After digging through some API documentation , I landed on this code to render my image
I used the tick_params call to basically shut down any extra information that might be rendered and I have a perfect graph in my output file :) . Hope this helps !
