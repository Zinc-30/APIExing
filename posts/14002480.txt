2D and 3D Scatter Histograms from arrays in Python
have you any idea , how I can bin 3 arrays to a histogram . My arrays look like
And the 1D plot should look :
And the 2D plot should ( qualitative ) look like :
So I want to bin one or two fields with python / numpy and then plot them to analyse their correspondence .
I'd definitely recommend the matplotlib package - using that you can write your code to plot both of those histograms - ( matplotlib.org/examples/axes_grid/scatter_hist.html )
Here it follows two functions : ` hist2d_bubble ` and ` hist3d_bubble ` ; that may fit for your purpose :
The two figures above were created using :

@USER I see your point ! I've updated the answer keeping only the bubble plot !
Thanks . I've taken back my -1 and deleted my now non-applicable comments . There is a somewhat subtle line of what is acceptable data manipulation and what is not . If you had a systematic method of shifting them ( say you know you should only get integer data and you reshape them into a spiral ) it would be ok , but adding random shifts is not . Using log scales is ok , using an arbitrary transform on your axes is not . Basically , should be invertable and conventional .
here's a bare-bones 2D version of Castro's code above . It simply plots the mean value at each x , y coordinate . This could be plotted using imshow but Castro's approach makes for a much neater scatter plot .
All the duplicated x , y points are now reduced to a unique set and their z values have been averaged :
