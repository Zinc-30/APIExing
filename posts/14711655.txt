How to prevent numbers being changed to exponential form in Python matplotlib figure
I'm using Matplotlib in Python to plot simple x-y datasets . This produces nice-looking graphs , although when I " zoom in " too close on various sections of the plotted graph using the Figure View ( which appears when you execute ` plt.show() ` ) , the x-axis values change from standard number form ( 1050 , 1060 , 1070 etc . ) to scientific form with exponential notation ( e.g. 1 , 1.5 , 2.0 with the x-axis label given as ` + 1.057e3 `) .
I'd prefer my figures to retain the simple numbering of the axis , rather than using exponential form . Is there a way I can force Matplotlib to do this ?

The formatting of tick labels is controlled by a ` Formatter ` object , which assuming you haven't done anything fancy will be a ` ScalerFormatter ` by default . This formatter will use a constant shift if the fractional change of the values visible is very small . To avoid this , simply turn it off :
If you want to avoid scientific notation in general ,
Can control this with globally via the ` axes.formatter.useoffset ` rcparam .
Thanks , that works . Apologies for the duplicate question too - I did search before posting it , but my searches included terms such as " scientific notation " and " exponential form " rather than " relative axis shifts " , which is what the previous user used .
@USER no worries
Is there a way to permanently force this change ? I've never found the scientific notation axes and always end up turning them off . I couldn't see an rcParam for this though .
@USER See update it is the ` axes.formatter.useoffset ` rcparam
Great , thanks ! I'd personally prefer to see this set to False by default , since it seems to confuse many and benefit few .
You can use something like :
You can use a simpler command to turn it off :
Thank you , simplest solution .
