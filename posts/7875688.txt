How can I create a standard colorbar for a series of plots in python
I using matplotlib to plot some data in python and the plots require a standard colour bar . The data consists of a series of NxM matrices containing frequency information so that a simple imshow() plot gives a 2D histogram with colour describing frequency . Each matrix contains data in different , but overlapping ranges . Imshow normalizes the data in each matrix to the range 0-1 which means that , for example , the plot of matrix A , will appear identical to the plot of the matrix 2*A ( though the colour bar will show double the values ) . What I would like is for the colour red , for example , to correspond to the same frequency in all of the plots . In other words , a single colour bar would suffice for all the plots . Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .
I prefer using matshow() or pcolor() because imshow() smoothens the matrix when displayed making interpretation harder . So unless the matrix is indeed an image , I suggest that you try the other two .
@USER - You can specify ` interpolation= ' nearest '` when using ` imshow ` if you don't want interpolation . ` pcolor ` is much slower than ` imshow ` for large arrays , so it's often better to use ` imshow ` for large-ish arrays . On the other hand , ` pcolor ` gives vector output , which can be very handy at times .

Not to steal @USER ' s answer , but I wanted to add an example ...
There are multiple ways , but the simplest is just to specify the ` vmin ` and ` vmax ` kwargs to ` imshow ` . Alternately , you can make a ` matplotlib.cm.Colormap ` instance and specify it , but that's more complicated than necessary for simple cases .
Here's a quick example with a single colorbar for all images :
Easiest solution is to call clim ( lower_limit , upper_limit ) with the same arguments for each plot .
Or just pass the ` vmin ` and ` vmax ` kwargs to ` imshow ` .
This only answer half of the question , or rather starts a new one .
If you change

your colorbar will go from 0 to 0.5 which in this case is dark blue to slightly lighter blue and will not cover the whole range ( 0 to 2 ) .
The colorbar will only show the colors from the last image or contour regardless of ` vmin ` and ` vmax ` .
