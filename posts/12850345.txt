how to combine two data frames in python pandas
I'm using python pandas data frame , I have a initial data frame say D . I extract two data frames from it like this :
` A = D [ D.label == k ]`
` B = D [ D.label ! = k ]`
then I change the label in A and B :
` B.label = -1 `
I want to combine A and B so I can have them as one data frame something like union . The order of the data not important , however when we sample A and B from D they retain their indexes from D .
its easier to get high quality answers if you accept correct ones ...
I believe you can use the ` append ` method
to keep their indexes just dont use the ` ignore_index ` keyword ...
This works . It creates a new DataFrame though . Is there a way to do it inline ? That would be nice for when I'm loading huge amounts of data from a database in batches so I could iteratively update the DataFrame without creating a copy each time .
You can also use ` pd.concat ` , which is particularly helpful when you are joining more than two dataframes :
Thought to add this here incase someone finds it useful . @USER already mentioned how you can merge the data frames across rows which is
To merge across columns , you can use the following syntax :
