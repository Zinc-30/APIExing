How to add group labels for bar charts in matplotlib ?
I want to plot data of the following form using matplotlib's bar plot feature :
The bar chart is supposed to look like this . The bar groups should be visible from the labels on the x axis . Is there any way to do this with matplotlib ?
Can you show us what you have tried ?
Since I could not find a built-in solution for this in matplotlib , I coded my own :
The " mk_groups " function takes a dictionary ( or anything with an items() method , like collections.OrderedDict ) and converts it to a data format that is then used to create the chart . It is basically a list of the form :
The " add_line " function creates a vertical line in the subplot at the specified positions ( in axes coordinates ) .
The " label_group_bar " function takes a dictionary and creates the bar chart in the subplot with the labels beneath . The result from the example then looks like this .
Easier or better solutions and suggestions are still very much appreciated .
please accept your own answer . If you are feeling ambitious , this could be a good addition to mpl proper ( I suspect this could be generalized a bit and folded up with dendograms ) .
thanks for reminding me .
no problem . I am serious about getting this into mpl proper though ( I am a dev and would help sheppard this through ) .
it tells me NameError : name ' xrange ' is not defined in for pos in xrange ( ly + 1 ):
if you are using Python 3 , xrange was renamed to range . so use range instead of xrange .
I was looking for this solution for a while Thanks .
I modified it some to work with a pandas data table .
Only fare to share .
