How to : reduce number of ticks with matplotlib
I have too many ticks on my graph and they are running into each other . How can I reduce the number of ticks ? For example , I have ticks :
and I only want :
I've tried playing with the LogLocator , but I haven't been able to figure this out . Suggestions ?
Thanks !
Alternatively , if you want to simply set the number of ticks while allowing matplotlib to position them ( currently only with ` MaxNLocator `) , there is ` pyplot.locator_params ` ,
You can specify specific axis in this method as mentioned below , default is both :
This was a great suggestion , also being able to specify ` pyplot.locator_params ( axis = ' x ' , nbins = 4 )` ( or ` axis = ' y '`) made the process really straightforward . Thanks @USER !
Much simpler solution - should be marked as best .
Is there any way I could use that with a FixedLocator ?
With log scale , this worked with ` numticks ` instead of ` nbins `
@USER , could you please add the ` numticks ` solution for logarithmic plots as pointed out by @USER ?
There's a ` set_ticks() ` function for axis objects .
This would work if I knew beforehand what ticks I wanted . The example I gave above was only an example . I don't know what the ticks are , I just know I want fewer of them , i.e. , every other one .
You could call ` get_xticks() ` or ` get_yticks() ` first for the axes object , edit as needed , and then pass the list back to ` set_ticks() ` .
Erm , I guess that would work embarrassed . Thanks .
I don't have ` set_ticks() ` , but I do have ` set_xticks() ` and ` set_yticks() ` . These are attributes of axes objects , not axis . Maybe this has changed during the last couple of years .
I am not sure if I should , some people have found your answer useful as is , and just because it is different for me does not mean it is for everybody .
When a log scale is used the number of major ticks can be fixed with the following command
The value set to ` numticks ` determines the number of axis ticks to be displayed .
Credits to @USER ' s post for introducing the ` locator_params() ` function , but the ` nticks ` parameter throws an error when a log scale is used .
