Python , Matplotlib , subplot : How to set the axis range ?

I would like to limit the X and Y axis in matplotlib but for a speific subplot . As I can see
subplot figure itself doesn't have any axis property . I want for example to change only the limits for the second plot !
how are you making the subplots ? Please show us what you are doing .
Is this more than one way to do it ???
your question was not clear , I can think of may 4 or 5 ways to set up something this simple with sub-plots .
If you can think of setting up in 4 or 5 ways , it shows that you already understood the question in the first place .
Because , I suspected that you have some gaps in your understanding of the class hierarchy of of mpl ( which your variable names confirm ) . Thus , you will benefit the most if I can show you how to adapt the code you already have .
You should learn a bit of the OO interface to matplotlib , not just the state machine interface . Almost all of the ` plt . * ` function are thin wrappers that basically do ` gca() . * ` .
` plt.subplot ` ( doc ) return an ` axes ` ( doc ) object . Once you have a referance to the axes object you can plot directly to it , change it's limits , etc .
and so on for as many axes as you want .
or better , wrap it all up in a loop :
Problem with keeping the axis instance is that it does not have all the properties that plt has , for example one cannot use axis.ylim() to get the ylim of the plot on an axis .
@USER You use ` set_xlim ` and ` set_ylim ` . ` plt ` has many fewer options than working directly with the axes object . In fact , almost every function in ` plt ` is a very thin wrapper that first calls ` ax = plt.gca() ` and then calls what ever function on that object . You should not be using ` plt ` for anything but interactive work .
Yes , I agree , not relying on the interactive version is preferable , but there is no way to get the ylim of a plot having only axis . After a plot is done , it will have an automatic ylim assigned , but the axis will not have that information . So if latter drawings depend on the ylim , as you said one has to set_ylim to override the current range .
sorry , forgot about that bit of magic in ` plt.ylim ` . There is also a ` get_ylim() ` function on the ` axes ` which will return the limits and ` ax.get_yaxis() ` function which will return to you the ` axis ` ( note difference between ` axes ` and ` axis `) . There are also the symmetric versions for the xaxis .
