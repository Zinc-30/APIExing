Replacing	O
NaN	O
with	O
row	O
average	O

I	O
am	O
trying	O
to	O
learn	O
pandas	O
but	O
i	O
have	O
been	O
puzzled	O
with	O
the	O
following	O
please	O
.	O

I	O
want	O
to	O
replace	O
NaNs	O
is	O
a	O
dataframe	B-API
with	O
the	O
row	O
average	O
.	O

Hence	O
something	O
like	O
`	O
df.fillna	B-API
(	O
df.mean	B-API
(	O
axis=1	O
))`	O
should	O
work	O
but	O
for	O
some	O
reason	O
it	O
fails	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

Am	O
I	O
missing	O
anything	O
please	O
,	O
something	O
I'm	O
doing	O
wrong	O
?	O

Is	O
is	O
because	O
its	O
not	O
implemented	O
;	O
see	O
link	O
here	O

However	O
something	O
like	O
this	O
looks	O
to	O
work	O
fine	O

That	O
functionality	O
is	O
still	O
not	O
implemented	O
-	O
the	O
issue	O
remains	O
open	O
.	O

Ok	O
,	O
thanks	O
for	O
this	O
!	O

As	O
commented	O
the	O
axis	O
argument	O
to	O
fillna	B-API
is	O
NotImplemented	O
.	O

Note	O
:	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
critical	O
here	O
as	O
you	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
fill	O
in	O
your	O
nth	O
columns	O
with	O
the	O
nth	O
row	O
average	O
.	O

For	O
now	O
you'll	O
need	O
to	O
iterate	O
through	O
:	O

An	O
alternative	O
is	O
to	O
fillna	B-API
the	O
transpose	B-API
and	O
then	O
transpose	B-API
,	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
more	O
efficient	O
...	O

Thanks	O
