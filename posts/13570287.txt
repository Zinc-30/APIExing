Image overlay in 3d plot using python
I have a 3d plot of lines generated by matplotlib . I want to overlay an image at a specific xy ( or yz , xz ) slice . How do I do that using python ? Thanks .
I have a simple 3d plot code as :
I also have an image " Im " ( a 2d array ) , so I need something like :
What have you tried so far ? Please include your source code in your question .
I could not find any options at all .
I did a 3d surface plot overlay on top of a background image once :
If this is similar to what you want , I could try to make a working example out of it .
Alternatively , if you just want to display an image in 3d space , you can use a surface plot :
Of course , the stride values can be decreased to 1 for better image quality , but then drawing will take loooong =)
Resulting image from above code :
the second example combined with 3d plot of curves is what I wanted . thanks a lot . I think , I can plot curves over image by simply using hold ( True ) option ...
Thanks it's helpful for me . But , I have one question , is there any way to make an image be placed under 3d data plot ? In here , an image keeps floating over ` bar3d ` .
@USER I would like to know more about the first example . I have an image which I want to stay on the x , y plane ( z=0 ) . On top of that image is going to be my 3D curve . How to do it ?
