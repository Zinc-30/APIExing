Filter dataframe rows if value in column is in a set list of values
I have a Python pandas DataFrame `rpt`:
I can filter the rows whose stock id is `'600809'` like this: `rpt[rpt['STK_ID'] == '600809']`
and I want to get all the rows of some stocks together, such as `['600809','600141','600329']`. That means I want a syntax like this:
Since pandas not accept above command, how to achieve the target?
