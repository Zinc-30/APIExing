Partial coloring of text in matplotlib
Is there a way in matplotlib to partially specify the color of a string ?
Example :
How can I show " today " as red , " is " as green and " cloudy . " as blue ?
Thanks .
I think you would have to hack it with 3 separate text boxes .
Ask on matplotlib mailing list . It might be possible with custom renderer or " Artist " perhaps .

I only know how to do this non-interactively , and even then only with the ' PS ' backend .
To do this , I would use Latex to format the text . Then I would include the ' color ' package , and set your colors as you wish .
Here is an example of doing this :
This results in ( converted from ps to png using ImageMagick , so I could post it here ):
I would use this one , if only it were to work with the PDF backend :) For some reason , I can never get the axes placed properly on the canvas while I am working with the ps backend .
I'm sorry - I didn't mean to downvote this . I meant to upvote it , and I must have misclicked earlier .
Very nice solution . Is there a way to create ` pdf `' s ? Aside from saving it as ` ps ` and then ` ps2pdf ` , which pretty much screws up everything in my graph ...
What a simple solution to this problem . If only it worked with more backends !
here's the interactive version ( same one I posted to the list )
It looks like the words aren't exactly aligned in the vertical version .
This was actually a bug in matplotlib at the time I wrote that comment . It has since been fixed , as you can see here .
Extending Yann's answer , LaTeX coloring now also works with PDF export :
Note that this python script sometimes fails with ` Undefined control sequence ` errors in the first attempt . Running it again is then successful .
