How to use a ( random ) * .otf or * .ttf font in matplotlib ?
How can I use any type of font in my font library on my computer ( e.g. ` *otf ` or ` *ttf `) in all my ` matplotlib ` figures ?
See the example here : http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/api/font_file.html
In general , you'd do something like this if you're wanting to use a specific ` .ttf ` file . ( Keep in mind that pointing to a specific font file is usually a bad idea ! )
Usually , you'd just point to the name of the font , and let matplotlib worry about finding the specific file . E.g .
If you want to have matplotlib always use a particular font , then customize your ` .matplotlibrc ` file . ( ` font.family ` is what you'd want to set . Note that you should specify the name of the font , not the path to a specific .ttf file . )
As an example of doing this dynamically ( i.e. without setting up a specific ` .matplotlibrc ` file ):
On * nix , you can use all your system fonts by enabling matplotlib's fontconfig backend .
However matplotlib does not really talk to fontconfig libraries it emulates its behaviour by running fontconfig cli utilities .
Therefore , nuking the matplotlib fontconfig cache so it discovers new fonts can be a lifesaver ( the existence of this cache is direct proof of lack of complete fontconfig integration ) .
