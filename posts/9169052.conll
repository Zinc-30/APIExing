Is	O
there	O
a	O
way	O
in	O
matplotlib	O
to	O
partially	O
specify	O
the	O
color	O
of	O

How	O
can	O
I	O
show	O

I	O
think	O
you	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
hack	O
it	O
with	O
3	O

Ask	O
on	O

It	O
might	O
be	O
possible	O
with	O

I	O
only	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
non-interactively	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
then	O
only	O
with	O
the	O
'	O
PS	O

To	O
do	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
use	O
Latex	O
to	O
format	O
the	O
text	O

Then	O
I	O
would	O
include	O
the	O
'	O
color	O

package	O

set	O
your	O
colors	O
as	O
you	O
