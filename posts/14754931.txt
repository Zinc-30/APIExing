Interactive pixel information of an image in Python ?

I'm using ` matplotlib.imshow ` to get an interactive display of a 2D array . The x / y coordinate under the cursor is displayed at the bottom left of the window . Is it possible to also get the value of the array under the cursor as well ?

You simply need to re-assign ` ax.format_coord ` . See this example from the documentation .
( code lifted directly from example )
I needed something I could re-use , so I encapsulated the solution through a class :
Example usage :
Features :
Can show both floats and complex values . For complex , the real+imaginary parts and polar form are shown .
Will set the extent for you , based on the x and y arrays . Note that the matplotlib example works only if you don't use the extent keyword .
Pixels are centered around their ( x , y ) position instead of ( x , y ) being the lower ( or upper ) left location .
Reading this again , the use use of that class is a bit funny as you don't keep a ref to it but rely on the format_coord ref to keep the object alive . You can run exactly the same thing by just doing a closure directly .
