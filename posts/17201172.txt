A logarithmic colorbar in matplotlib scatter plot
I would like to make the colors of the points on the scatter plot correspond to the value of the void fraction , but on a logarithmic scale to amplify differences . I did this , but now when I do plt.colorbar() , it displays the log of the void fraction , when I really want the actual void fraction . How can I make a log scale on the colorbar with the appropriate labels of the void fraction , which belongs to [ 0.00001 , 1 ] ?
Here is an image of the plot I have now , but the void fraction colorbar is not appropriately labeled to correspond to the true void fraction , instead of the log of it .
Thanks for your help .
There is now a section of the documentation describing how color mapping and normalization works ( that is a link to the development documentation , but applies to all versions of mpl . It will be in the mainline documentation ' soon ')
The way that ` matplotlib ` does color mapping is in two steps , first a ` Normalize ` function ( wrapped up by the sub-classes of ` matplotlib.colors.Normalize `) which maps the data you hand in to ` [ 0 , 1 ]` . The second step maps values in ` [ 0 , 1 ]` - RGBA space .
You just need to use the ` LogNorm ` normalization class , passed in with the ` norm ` kwarg .
When you want to scale / tweak data for plotting , it is better to let ` matplotlib ` do the transformations than to do it your self .

` LogNorm ` doc
` matplotlib.color ` doc
Perfect , thank you !
The result is in Fig 2 . pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/cp/c3cp55039g I added Stack Overflow in the acknowledgements !
Thank you ! IF only the docs hinted at where to look . There are all these fantastic functions with fantastic parameters offering fantastic possibilities but nothing on how to use them .
Please suggest edits to the docs based on what you now understand
