Color matplotlib plot_surface command with surface gradient
I would like to convert surf command from MATLAB to plot_surface command in matplotlib .
The challenge I am facing is when using cmap function in plot_surface command to color the surface with gradient .
Here is the matlab script
The figure from such a command can be found here . ( http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/visualize/f0-18164.html#f0-46458 )
Here is the python scipt
When using python and matplotlib to create a similar function I am unable to color the surface with a gradient .
I get the following error message :
Any inputs would be helpful .
Praboo
First , it looks like you want the colors mapped from gradient magnitude . You are trying to use the gradient vectors which is why you are getting the ' list ' error .
Second , you can supply a cmap , but it only defines how you want the Z values mapped to a color . If you want new face colors then use the ` facecolors ` argument .
Third , you'll want to normalize the values to 0 .. 1 then map them thru a colormap . ( I think there is another way , but dividing the magnitude by the max is pretty simple )
Here's the code :
And the result :
Fantastic . Thank you Paul .
How would you add colorbar to this plot to reflect the change in colormap .
@USER You need to instantiate a ScalarMappable . This is an interesting and non-trivial topic and the community would be well-served if this were introduced as a separate question .
